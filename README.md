Flappy Bird Game

Welcome to my Flappy Bird game! This project is a fun take on the classic Flappy Bird game, where I use my own face as the bird’s face. It showcases my skills in Python and game development while adding a personal touch to the gameplay experience.

Features

	•	Custom Bird Face: Play with a bird that has my face, making the game more entertaining and unique.
	•	Simple Controls: Easy-to-learn controls to keep the game accessible for all ages.
	•	Challenging Gameplay: Navigate through obstacles and try to achieve the highest score!

Technologies Used

	•	Python: The primary programming language used for game development.
	•	Pygame: A popular library for creating games in Python.
	•	Tkinter: For the graphical user interface (GUI).
	•	PIL (Pillow): To handle image processing.
